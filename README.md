##Autogenerated description
This script is a Python program that fills a table in a Word document with data from an Excel workbook. The program takes four command-line arguments: the name of the Excel file, the name of the Word file, the starting row in the Excel worksheet, and the number of rows to fill in the Word table.

The program uses the openpyxl library to read data from the Excel workbook and the docx library to modify the Word document. It opens the Excel workbook and selects the active worksheet, then loads the Word document and gets the first table and header row.

It then searches the header row for temporary words and their positions, and searches the first row of the Excel worksheet for their corresponding positions. It then iterates through the non-empty rows in the Excel worksheet and adds a new row to the Word table for each one.

For each new row, the program replaces the temporary words in the header row with the corresponding data from the Excel worksheet. Finally, the program saves the modified Word document with a "0" added to the beginning of the filename. If there are not enough command-line arguments, the program prints a usage message and exits with an error code of 1.
